Name:
	tenaciousIRC -- tIRC
Base:
	Fully-functioning browser-based chat system
	that works via chatrooms.

Extra:
	Permits users to compile and run a program 
	from a given source file on the server, and 
	allows the group of users to interact with it
	via messages.

	The point of this is to allow a platform-independent
	demonstration of a program without giving away the
	source code.
